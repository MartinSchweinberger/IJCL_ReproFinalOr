# Introduction

This repository accompanies the article *Reproducibility and transparency in interpretive corpus pragmatics* and showcases the interpretative analysis of the use of utterance final *or* in informal spoken Australian English. 

Overview of the relevant\* contents of this repository 

+ The file **ufor-Part1.Rmd** represents the R Notebook which contains the first part (data extraction and processing) of the analysis of utterance-final *or*. 
+ The file **ufor-Part1.html** represents a HTML document, resulting from rendering the R Notebook which contains the first part (data extraction and processing) of the analysis of utterance-final *or*. 
+ The file **ufor-Part2.Rmd** represents the R Notebook which contains the second part (data analysis) of the analysis of utterance-final *or*. 
+ The file **ufor-Part2.html** represents a HTML document, resulting from rendering the R Notebook which contains the second part (data analysis) of the analysis of utterance-final *or*. 
+ The file **ufor-Part2_INTERCATIVE.ipynb** represents an interactive Jupyter Notebook which allows the reprodcution of the second part (data analysis) of the analysis of utterance-final *or*. The code chunks in this  interactive Jupyter Notebook can we *run* by clicking on the play button. Additionally, the code can be edited and changed to inspect other examples of utterance-final *or*.

# Corpus Data

The data for this analysis are corpora that are part of the *Australian National Corpus*. The corpora used in this study are:
 * *Australian Radio Talkback* 
 * *Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English*  
 * *The Monash Corpus of Spoken English*  
 * *The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English*   


# Instructions for use

The notebooks in this reporsitory assume that the corpora are stored in a subdirectory labelled *data*. While the entire code (see [here for the R notebook](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor-Part1.Rmd)  representing the first part of the analysis and [here](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor-Part2.Rmd) for the R notebook representing the second part of the analysis) representing the analysis is made avialable in raw and rendered format (see [here](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor-Part1.html)  for a rendered html version of the first part of the analysis and see [here](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor-Part2.html) for a rendered html version of the second part of the analysis), we decided against uploading and making the data available in this reporsitory for copyright reasons. The interactive notebook therefore start with the analysis at a point where the instances of speech-unit final *or* are extracted from the corpus data.   

# Interactive notebook

If you click on the link below, an interactive Jupyter notebook will start up in your browser so you can check the anaysis, inspect the examples, execute the commands yourself, and also probe the data in more detail as well as tabulating and slicing the date both as done in the study as well as in ways you are intersted in tabulating and slicing the data.

\* With relevant we mean files and documents that have more than porely technical relevance. For instnace, the install.R file has only technical relevance as it contains information about what packages need to be installed for the interactive Jupyter notebook.
