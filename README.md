# Introduction

This reporsitory accompanies the article *How to improve reproducibility in corpus pragmatics* and showcases the interpretative analysis of the use of utterance final *or* in informal spoken Australian English. 

# Corpus Data

The data for this analysis are corpora that are part of the *Australian National Corpus* which is hosted by the *Australian Rsearch Data Commons* (ARDC). The corpora used in this study are:
 * [*Australian Radio Talkback*](https://researchdata.edu.au/australian-radio-talkback/2008?source=undefined)  
 * *Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English*  
 * *The Monash Corpus of Spoken English*  
 * *The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English*   

The corpora can be downloaded free of charge from the [*ARDC Australian National Corpus* repository](https://researchdata.edu.au/australian-national-corpus/2018).

# Instructions for use

The notebooks in this reporsitory assume that the corpora are stored in a subdirectory labelled *data*. While the entire code (see [here for the R notebook](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor_cb.Rmd)) for the analysis is made avialable and displayed (see [here for a rendered pdf version of the R notebook](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/IJCL_ReproducibilityInCorpusPragmatics/blob/main/ufor_cb.pdf)), we decided against uploading and making the data available in this reporsitory for copyright reasons. Accordingly, the interactive notebooks start with the analysis at a point where the instances of speech-unit final *or* are extracted for the corpus data.

If you click on the link below, an interactive Jupyter notebook will start up in your browser so you can check the anaysis, inspect the examples, execute the commands yourself, and also probe the data in more detail as well as tabulating and slicing the date both as done in the study as well as in ways you are intersted in tabulating and slicing the data.
