# Introduction

This reporsitory accompanies the article *How to improve reproducibility in corpus pragmatics* and showcases the interpretative analysis of the use of speech unit final *or* in informal spoken Australian English. 

# Corpus Data

The data for this analysis are corpora that are part of the *Australian National Corpus* which is hosted by the *Australian Rsearch Data Commons* (ARDC). The corpora used in this study are:
 * [*Australian Radio Talkback*](https://researchdata.edu.au/australian-radio-talkback/2008?source=undefined)  
 * *Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English*  
 * *The Monash Corpus of Spoken English*  
 * *The La Trobe Corpus of Spoken Australian English*   

The corpora can be downloaded free of charge from the [*ARDC Australian National Corpus* repository](https://researchdata.edu.au/australian-national-corpus/2018).

# Instructions for use

The notebooks in this reporsitory assume that the corpora are stored in a subdirectory labelled *data*. While the entire code for the analysis is made avialable and displayed, we decided against uploading and making the data available in this reporsitory for copyright reasons. Accordingyl, the interactive notebooks start with the analysis at a point where the instances of speech-unit final *or* are extracted fro the corpus data.
