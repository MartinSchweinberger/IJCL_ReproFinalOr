15     like I haven’t um like talked to them for ages. I’m kind of
16     let our friendship like kind of like neglected like I never
17     write to them e-mail so I really wanna see all of them again

23     December and January probably yeah

25     D:    Part of January
26     L:    Do you wanna do any sightseeing while you’re there?
27     D:    Ah yea definitely, I was thinking maybe like Kyoto and stuff
28     like that but um lot of people said that Kyoto isn’t that
29     (1.0) like people say that it’s cool but actually not when
30     we get there
31     L:    [Um::]
32     D:    [It’s just] like you see a few temples and that’s it
33     L:    Depends like [um - ]
34     D:                    [Have you been there?]
35     L:    I I went to Kyoto and umm if you do go, I recommend Fushimi
36     Inari
37          ((Fushimi Inari is the name of tample))
38     D:    Ahh:  o:kay
39     L:    It’s umm you know you might seen it in um both  and  travel  40

46     D:    Waoww::
47     L:    yeah
48     D:    Yeah coz a lot of people say like one of the weirdest things
49     about it is that kind of you’ve got a really old style home
50     right next to a Mc Donald’s or a seven eleven or something
51     it’s just kind of [two eras just merged together in one city ]
52     L:                       [Oh yeah I mean- ]
