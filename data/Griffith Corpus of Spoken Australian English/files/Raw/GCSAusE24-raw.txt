      so these guys are multihires (0.2) th’re technically for saturday
      nights: and anythin’ else we require.so: as they won’ let us hire any
      more ne:w starting staff the only other option is to go multihire an:d

      results they get from it. They’ll get six to seven hundred in the
      early show on the Saturday,which is better than the Thur:sday,
