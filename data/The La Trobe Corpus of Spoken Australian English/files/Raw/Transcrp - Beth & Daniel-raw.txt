B:    …no problem
K:    Ok Daniel I might get you to just tell me what you miss most about France?
D:    What I miss most [about France]
K                     [yeah] since you’ve been away
D:    Aaah partly food even if in Australia the food is not so bad
B:    He he he
D:    aah we’re talking about A.. Australia here?
K      yeah…or…[yeah]
D:                        [because] before I was in USA and USA was awful to find good coffee very good bread and finding good
      cheese which is I think very French but ah I need that ...
K      yeah yup
K:    And have you found good cheese in Australia? [‘cos I ???????]
D:                                          [Yeah from] Tasmania I could find some I could found pretty good cheese …
B     yeah
K     yeah
D:    yeah so first perhaps erm yeah the food after my friends I mean it’s not so it is not only fr.. my friends too ‘cos I have
      nobody to talk with and er yeah it’s not easy and in a way my family sometimes yeah and er yeah as I said
K:    what do you think has been the most difficult part about living in Australia in particular? What do you find difficult?
D:    aah phew I don’t know ah life is pretty easy people are very open
B     [uh huh…]
D     [which] is very nice
K     you can disagree
B:    he he he
D:    umm but I what I find is phew s.. perhaps the lack of culture ‘cos of when I’ve been travelling I was um I really enjoy
      for example South America it was very strong
B      mmm
D     even if it’s a catholic culture in a way aah it’s .. I I find people and very different from what I know being as French
K     uh hmmm
D     so it was very rich very interesting so Aus..  Australia and New Zealand whatever it’s ah English culture so it’s not so
      different for me .. um I find that people here are very creative more than the French for example
K/B   uh hmmm
D     are more free to do whatever they want which is very interesting but what I miss is culture er it’s pretty hard to explain
      Ffr example I’ve been spending time in Morocco which were amazing for me because it was very strong very rich um I find
      that pretty difficult to leave and stay all the time here
B      mmm
D     perhaps just me perhaps it seems this way but er
      K:    what would you umm how would you describe a typical Australian? maybe you could describe that to Beth and Beth can
      see if she agrees with you on that?
B     [yeah]
K     [be]cause I’m actually not Australian [so]
D                                  [ok]
B     it’s funny someone asked one of my students yesterday she’s from Japan asked me she wanted to send a present home to her
      father and she came to and she said “what’s something typically Australian that I could send home?” and I thought “oh
      what’s.. I mean… kangaroo [and all the things people think of]
D                                                                    [yeah yeah yeah]
B              but I was trying to think of something and um someone later in the day came up with wine a good Australian wine
      but… it’s hard I  I found yesterday just thinking about it I found it hard to think of something typically Australian well
      not well something like that a gift but to think of the typical Australian
K:    it [might be easier]
B        [I think I’d] balk at the typical Australian honestly don’t tell me
D     Aahh
K:     it might be easier for an outsider =
B:                                 =  yeah I think so
D:     I know it’s not easy I don’t know.. for me they’re very easy going very open people not so stressful as in France they
      take time to live um they have a lot of friends and they’re pretty relaxed er
B:    ……. Yeah
D:    it’s very hard
B:    I’d agree we’re sort of relaxed
D:    yeah
B:    yeah
D:     laid-back and yeah I don’t know
B:    pretty open
D:    oh yeah [pretty]
B:           [mm]
D:    open yeah yeah
K:    so they’re the main differences between the French and the Australians?
D:    ……… perhaps except the language for sure perhaps
K/B/D  HA HA HA
K:    have you been to France?
B:    I haven’t I wish I had but erm but yeah from what I’ve heard I mean French people have a reputation for being a bit closed
      maybe a bit not not closed but um
D:    ???? perhaps with English people creating this culture because they have always been fighting B:     [Aahh]
D:    [I mean] if you look at at the history in French the English have been fighting so from an English spoken person who go in
      France who doesn’t try to speak French I think we are pretty rude which is a shame even if you just talk too much in two
      words in English they just open try to help you and .. they are very open people I think
B:    are [they]?
K:          [the] French?
D:    no no the Australians
B:    oh
D:    more than the French [yeah]
B:                     [mm]
K:    what would be a typical French person do you think?
D:    phew it’s hard to answer that
B     yeah I don’t know
D:    Ahh I’m not sure I am but ah well it’s very pretentious to say that but ah…
K/D/B: ha ha ha
B:    so where are you from in France?
D:    southwest
B:    southwest [okay]
D:               [yeah] erm …. what’s a typical French person?
B:    from what I hear aren’t Parisians quite different to they sort of .. from what I’ve heard people say Parisians are a bit
      different to [to other people in]
D:                                  [that’s a cultural thing] yeah it’s a cultural.. north and south is very different a bit
      more relaxed perhaps in the south a bit more more open I think than Paris
K:    mm
D:    but living in Paris is very multipurpose like all the big towns everybody’s stressful it’s very hard I think even if it’s
      a very nice town people are very stressful there and um.. maybe for me who is coming from the south once I went there and I
      had time I was relaxed and just walking on the street and watching the buildings architecture .. sorry for my English …and
      er people just stop me and say “where are you from you’re not from here?” because I was smiling to people
B     [ha ha he]
D:    [?????? you know]
K:    yeah it’s interesting they say that the French don’t smile so easily at people they don’t know whereas.. I’ve just been
      reading a book about the difference between the French and Americans and Americans sort of smile at anything that moves =
B:                                           =  yeah [they do]
K:                                                  [like and] the French always find that a bit you know a bit over the top I
      suppose but they’re the complete opposite they don’t…  would you say that’s true or maybe just in Paris any[way]?
D:                                                 [I don’t] I don’t know about the Americans but about French yeah
K:    yeah why do you think that is why don’t you smile at people because I think maybe even the Australians smile at people
      more [easily]
B:                                 [mmm]
K                                        than the French smile at each other do you save smiles for people that you know?
B      ha ha ha
K     [or you can only have 6 smiles a day]
D:    [depends on my mood] depends on my mood but er I’m pretty moody so (ALL laugh) so in the morning if I have no coffee and
      no cigarettes I don’t smile =
K                                                      = you can’t smile (more laughing)
B:    Fair enough
K     Right so there…yeah so there’s a time for smiling in the afternoon (ALL laugh) okay
D:    er no it’s very hard to try to give definition about why you are
B:    Mmm
K:    [I know]
D:    [What I] can .. see is.. is er people got idea about how is the French
K      mmm
D     and we’re supposed to be very arrogant and er
K:    why do you think you have [that reputation]
B                              [I didn’t want to say that] before but that’s the rep... [yeah I was going to say that is the
      reputation isn’t it? and it’s erm]
D                                                                     [Yeah that’s the rep.. no yeah that is the reputation]
D:    erm
K:    why do you think that is what do you think it’s
D:    …. I don’t know ah…but in my case because my English is not good enough so when I’ll try to do to say things um perhaps I
      can sound a bit rude ‘cos I don’t know English erm very well
K     uh huh
D     so I’m not very polite or whatever um I don’t know I cannot tell you?
B     mmm
D     but I’ve I’ve seen...it’s funny ‘cos er I’ve meet other French when I was travelling in erm in Australia mainly in the
      wine industry and talking with French and funny I went once and see a French we were complaining all the time never happy
      (K/B laugh) and I say “wow” the French are like this it’s so shit…(ALL) LAUGHTER I was scared …so you don’t really realise
      it’s the way you are er
K     yeah
D     but I am I know .. people find I’m arrogant too er ‘cos I have troubles with my way of working or being.. it’s like for
      example which is stupid things but ah … English people their way of eating things …you’ve got morning tea you stop 10
      minutes you have a sandwich lunch you stop 10 minutes you have a sandwich .. 4 o’clock and after you have a cooked lunch at
      night um I’m not used to stop on the morning but I stop for at least one hour er for lunch [it’s very important for me]
B                                                                         [Mmm]
D     and er and I’ll say I’m sorry it’s my fr.. my own freedom I need that so I do it .. er and this way people thought I was
      very arrogant and very [??]
K                                            [okay]
D     which is my fault because I’m pretty stubborn
K:    so you are arrogant?
D:    I’m afraid ..and want to be (ALL laugh) and perhaps because I don’t know because French too I don’t think French use to
      travel around the world a lot like Australian can do
K     uh hmmm
D     or New Zealander or whatever
K     yup
D     so we got  problem to be open I think we got a pretty narrow [mind]
B:                                                   [see we’re] we’re just an island so we f.. all feel we have to [travel we
      have]
D:                         [yeah yeah]
B:                                              TO GO              anywhere we have to go [a long way]
D:                                                                    [yeah yeah]
B:    so we love
D:    and I don’t [think we have this]
B:                 [we seem to love to travel]
D:                                                                      oh sorry I don’t think we have this capacity of
      adaptation and be open because you know people just stay in their village or their town doesn’t what’s [happen]
B:    [mmm]
D:    ing around the world
K:    well you get people like that here [as well]
B:                                 [You do in the country]
D:                                               [Yeah]               in the countryside =
B:                                                                = yeah and in central Australia they don’t know anywhere
D:    mmm
B:    they never go anywhere
D:                        [but er yeah]
B:                              [apart from] [sometimes]
D:                                     [because]
B:    mm
D:                                                                     but erm I think the main population are er in town and
      big cities in Australia but in France l.. a lot of population are living in the country side =
B:                                                                 =  [yeah]
D:                                                                      [I’m] coming from the country side
B:    heh heh
D:    so…
B:    yeah our our population is mostly around our our coast and in our cities where [where]
D:                                                                        [yeah hmmm]
B:    we’ve got people scattered but it’s it’s sort of erm yeah mostly in the cities… because of the yeah because of the country
      side heh heh heh not very easy to live out in the [middle]
D:                                                                    [yeah sure] and because you’ve got a lot of people here
      got roots I mean got parents or grandparents perhaps in Europe too so… I don’t [know]
B:                              [yeah]
D:                                   if that’s why you travel .. in New Zealand for example I was very surprised each .. person
      of my age spent has been spending like 3 or 4 years overseas
K/B:  mmm
D:    have been travelling you know [a lot of] [times ]
K:                                  [yeah]
B:                                           [mmm]
D:    which is you would never find that in France =
B:                                           = really?
K:       How old are you?
D:    I.. I’m 26
K:    right yeah that’s
B:    yeah well I.. dunno some statistic I heard about Australians apparently we have more passports per head than
D:    [y..]
B:    [A]NY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE we’re all just we’re all just  travelling we’re all [tryi..]
D                           [yeah]
B:                                going out to see .. yeah =
D:                                                         = s.. so I [think in this way]
B:                                                           [??????????????]
D:                                                                yeah because you travelling a lot you’re more open and and
      perhaps because er there is a lot of different communities too in this population of Australia
K:    mm yeah
B:    yeah
D:    you have in a way perhaps to be more open I don’t know [it’s just…]
K:                                                   [yeah]         yeah well that leads me nicely to my next question
ALL laugh
K:    that was a nice connector there.. what does “multiculturalism” mean really? Like we all have this label and =
B:                    = yeah
K:    all these communities together um do you think it really works like do you.. first of all do you think Australia and/or
      France are multicultural countries and do you think it really works? Do we all live together [happily] ever after?
B:                       [Mmmm]                 I think um it’s interesting ‘cos I’m working in a.. a TAFE college in the city
      and all of my.. all of the students are from overseas (?) it’s a private college so we have all international students from
      from everywhere and um so I’ve sort of been thinking about that in a way for a little while but um … it’s I love I love
      having all the different cultures together and I think it it works I think Australia’s still working it out I think we’re
      not quite there yet but um people have to be accepting of each other but also i.. you.. like I think with people that com..
      groups of people that come from overseas I think it’s fine to live in a community so long as they also sort of embrace the
      culture they’re in as well they don’t need to lose their culture but I find it a bit strange when you have someone in a
      country any country that’s been there 20 30 years and they don’t speak the language of the country that they’re in (?)
K:        mm
B:    and I find that a bit funny I think if people hold on and do that then that’s not really you know mixing and and but um I
      think we’ve got a fair I’d I’d say um I’d say Australia’s multicultural I don’t know about France but heh heh
D:    aah .. yup I think what you are saying is erm somebody spend 20 years for example in Australia should speak Eng[lish]
B:                   [mmm]
D:    erm but I think that’s true but it depends on if it’s somebody of 40 years old that come here it’s very hard for him [to
      speak English]
B:                    [oh yes yes]
D:    but when it’s kids [???]
B:                     [yeah] yeah oh I I mean they don’t need to speak I don’t mean they need to speak great English or great
      French or wherever they are but just you do meet some people that um live you know sort of live their life separate to to
      anything Australian (?) they sort of block it off and don’t even try to learn the language yeah I mean probably rare cases
      but I think you I ..I.. you do come across people like that and I think that sort of is I mean it one little thing that
      might block multiculturalism from working erm because erm well I’ve heard people talk.. you know Australians say you know
      that’s s.. something that they have trouble with with accepting people that are like that but I um I love having people
      coming from over different countries I think that’s great and I think it’s good for the people that are here too
K:    mmm
D:    yeah I I like being [with]
B:                     [if that] makes sense @@@@@
D:    wi.. with people of different countries that’s why I’m travelling erm … I don’t think France is like Australia we got um
      big problems with immigration like a lot of country in Europe .. I don’t know what was going on with um England but um for
      example in Germany there is a lot of of Turkish people too much um French we are su.. er France we’re supposed to be one of
      the best countries for freedom whatever it’s like ?????? and I think it’s the wo.. one of the worst country today for
      immigration erm
K:    worst in what sense?
D:    there is no possible today for people who want immigrate in France except if they have a very good job or they are in a
      political very hard political situation um we got er some awful stuff now like people from Africa .. because we have
      colonies in Africa so France was for people who have nothing to eat or whatever .. was ?????? normally and they they arrive
      in France find a job er which is not legal and the the government pick them up they just take them back on the plane and
      see you um … we have in the in the fifties in France mainly in the south discovered gas and stuff and petrol so the French
      government did need erm erm people to work but very hard jobs that the French didn’t want to do so they asked people from
      North Africa to come over which is Morocco Algeria so it was the fifties ah end of fifties so now since then we got three
      generation of people ah so parents are coming from um North Africa they are not very mixed I mean they still got the face
      of er you know Moroccan of Algerian so they speak both languages speak French very well and also speak the language from
      their parents but they’re not accept accepted … and um because there is no more job anyway for French or them lot of people
      tends to say “okay so now you come back in your country we don’t need you any more” but the problem is the kids are born
      there so there is  lot of racism problem and people say “oh we don’t want you anymore” ‘cause they’re French
B:    mmm
D:    um and so the parents went in the fifties and were I don’t know around 30 or 40s or perhaps o.. older so it was very hard
      for them to speak French so still today they are they are not speaking French but erm they have done a lot I think to try
      to be um integrate in [French]
B:                                                             [mmm]
D:                                                                   erm society but the culture is so different from ours
B:    mmm
D:    and um and we’ve been taking them putting them together and not trying to mix them they don’t want to mix them so they all
      park you know in the same building and we keep them apart so mixing people is not easy
B:    yeah =
D:            = so you .. so today is it’s a big problem and I don’t think France is great for that we have a lot of problems
      African people and and and people coming from North Africa =
B:                                                                 = I still I think Australia has problems too I mean we have
      the political party the “One Nation” party that was sort of against people immigrating and and that’s just been that’s sort
      of blown Australia apart in a way people are divided on that but um like I just got a pamphlet the other day um about
      refugees and it’s incredible how many um er refugees come to Australia and they’re kept in detention they’re kept in
      terrible [terrible]
D:                                [yeah]
B:    conditions and it and it’s um ‘cos my neighbour across the road is a big supporter of it and um um yeah the the statistics
      like apparently they are allowed to come in on boats legally they’re allowed to but we Australia [detains them]
K:                                                    [oh okay right]
B:    and they get held and they go through trials and things and 90% of them are allowed to stay in the end so it’s just a
      horrible process
K:        mmm
B:    and I think Australia has a lot to work on in in things like that but um but people .. I mean we have good .. er
      Melbourne’s very good for for lots of different cultures and lots of different people =
D:          = that’s what I think [yeah]
B:                               [it’s a] good place to to be for that .. I think people seem to be more tolerant down here than
      say up in some places in Queensland or in the country or [somewhere]
D:                                                                       [yeah yeah]
K:        [mmm]
B:    [but erm] yeah the government still has a lot to work work on @@@ but they’re trying for it I think
K:        yeah
B:    overall
K:    do you think Australians can be quite racist as well?
B:    yeah yup definitely because they’re very um there’s a lot of people that are unpa.. ...no can’t say that not the ones that
      don’t travel but a lot of people that haven’t you know up in Queen.. because I come from Queensland there are a lot of
      country people that don’t mix with with people from overseas and so they’re they’re prejudiced against them and you know we
      call them “Rednecks” @@ [@ you know and you know]
D:                    [yeah but er and in San Francisco it’s the same]
B:                                                           I guess there is people like that everywhere but yeah in in in
      different up in Queensland we find there’s lots more people North Queensland lots more people like that than down here ..
      maybe
D:    in [in er]
B:        [to a] different degree
D:    in France it’s the same yeah it’s just xenophobia which is French for xénophobie
K:    er xenophobia
D:    [ah okay]
B:    [ah yep]
D:              it’s just coming from the fact that you are afraid about the difference you know
B:    mmm =
D:              = and I thi.. it’s funny ‘cause in France this this national er political party erm got a lot of success but
      mainly with peoples coming from countryside they never seen an African or whatever they are just living in their small farm
      I don’t know they’re not thinking
K:        mmmm
D:    it’s just very scary
B:    yeah
K:        mmm
D:    and after something I I think er young people when er young kids arrive 10 in Australia come in 10 years old coming from
      another country I think it’s pretty they still able to learn the language and mix with other [people]
B:                       [mmmm]
D:    I don’t know …when you’re older it’s not so easy
B:    no
D:    but ?? and after I think when you you’re far away from your country if you hasn’t if you haven’t really choose to
      immigrate or if you have no choice because of situa[tion economical(?)]
B:                                                        [yeah political] or what have you
D:    um if you think I don’t know if you think you have to spend all my life here in a way you try to find again um all the
      different stuff you had before like um the kind of food or whatever =
B:                                                                          = [yeah]
D:                                                                           [in our] culture or religion that’s why perhaps
      people tends to be together
B:    mm
D:    and [don’t wanna mix]
B:           [you want to keep]
D:    [yeah]
B:    [keep] that part of your [home]
D:                       [yeah]
B:                             you want to keep your culture [yeah]
D:                                                    [and] and don’t tend to mix with [the other]
B:    [mm mm]
D:    ones too and er [so]
B:                [yeah]
D:                     I don’t know
B:    yeah I think it’s important to keep
D:    [your cul..]
B:    [the] culture
D:    yeah
B:    yeah
D:    that’s yeah that’s a problem [yeah]
B:                               [it’s] yeah with political refugees or or refugees it’s very it’s a very difficult situation
D:    you have to be yeah you have I think you have to keep your own culture and be very strong with that but still and have to
      being open on [wha..]
B:                                   [ mm ]
D:    what’s going on .. which is not so easy
K:    [mmm ]
B:    [not really]
D:    erm it’s like in Fr.. we in France we have a very particular problem which is Basque country where I live people are
      fighting for their culture =
B:                                           = uh huh
D:    but erm if you see the history it was in France for examples there was people who were travelling all around the world we
      say that the Basque discover Amerique before Christophe Colomb you know so people got very strong culture but they’re still
      very open about other cultures I think this is a way
K:    that’s interesting actually I watched a program on the the Sp.. Spanish Basques they would kill me for saying that (ALL
      laugh) the Basque country that is currently part of Spain and they were saying that now they’re contacting the people that
      live in the on the French side of the Basque country but do the French ha the French Basques (B laugh) I’m getting myself
      into…oh we’ll just scrap that (B/D laugh) the people who live in the Basque country on the French side of the border do
      they want their independence as much as the ones that live on the Spanish side of the border?
D:    the problem is [that]
K:               [you] never hear that much [about]
B:                                         [no you] don’t actually =
D:                                                           = no the problem is very different but mainly it’s.. the biggest
      past of er part of Basque country is in Spain [not]
K:                                                                      [right]
D:    in France France is very small
K:    okay
D:    erm but I think historic.. in a his.. historical point of view sorry
K:    uh hmm =
D:            = for my English erm the Spanish side recently had Franco whi.. Franco which was a dictator and he did hate the
      Basque because they had this strong culture
K:    right =
D:            = so in fact what we know today which is er er E.T.A [ETA] [which is]
B:                                                      [yep]   [yep]
D:    terrorism
K:     yep
D:    is bombed because they wanted to kill Franco so.. but in France they never had Franco so they are very very hard harder in
      Spain because of that I think
K:    right
D:     more than in France and er they and in another way they didn’t wanted to have people fighting in France because all
      people who used to fight in Spain if they get in trouble could go in France you know it’s like on the war it’s you got the
      first line but after you can come back and have a rest that’s why I think
B:     mmm that’s interesting yeah I hadn’t ever thought about the
K:     yup
B:     the Basque people in =
D:                     = ye[ah]
B:                            [Fra]nce =
K:                                     = no
B:     and you don’t hear much about them you don’t hear anything about [them]
D:                                                         [no there is not [er]
B:                                                                     [you] just hear about ETA
D:    it’s just er they were a small group er but they just bombed er like people who wanted to build buildings on the coast
      because they just try to protect the coast .. it was not against er physical including people they er just kill somebody
      once
K:        mmm right mmm okay well we’ll move onto [another subject]
D:                                       [yeah sorry]
B:    @@@@
K:        no no it’s just it was just a.. the thought of that was interesting. Um how important do you consider honesty and
      truthfulness in a relationship?
B:    either one of us? @@@@
K:    anyone
B:    very @@@ I.. I.. I base my relationships on honesty and truthfulness um … althou::gh .. I think in our culture perhaps we
      um .. don’t always e::r… I mean oh it’s interesting .. in terms of how we um we do deal with people perhaps we’re not so
      honest we might put on a smiley face and and not mention things and and perhaps brush over things when we might be thinking
      something else but .. I guess that’s natural for people anywhere but [um]
K:                                                       [I was] going to ask do you think being truthful is more important than
      being polite?
B:    er …… (3 secs)
D:    [??@@@@ ????]
B:    [go ahead go go go] no you go I’m thinking about it
K:    For the tape Daniel just nodded

K:     uh hmm
D:    er if I don’t like somebody er will be very hard that’s why in a way I’m rude.. I think I will it will be very hard for me
      to say “how are you?” I won’t [and I will be]
K:                                                [hmm mmm]
D:    perhaps rude yeah er but I think being true towards your own feelings which is very hard and towards somebody else is very
      hard in our society
B:    y[eah]
D:      [in the] world of everyday and and having a job whatever this always you have to play you know in relationship has
      seduction there is always seduction
K:        hmm mmm

D:                                  [???????             why?]                   seduction

B:    mm mm oh that’s [good]
D:                     [so]
B:                          to know
K:     it’s [useful]       [yeah]
B:           [it’s use]ful [@@@]
D:           [I just]
B:    okay
D:    I just try to um (2) how to pf.. it’s hard to say that in English yeah it’s the same we can use it in a general way
B:     is that the same in Spanish? Seducción
K:     I don’t know
B:     No [I wonder]
K:               [I don’t think] I’ve ever used it in Spanish I’ve never had that sort of (all @@@@) situation… no I don’t know
      actually
B:     aah
K:     I don’.. is it seducir?
B/D:   mmmm
D:     mm creo
K:     is and does it is it more like the French =
D:                                    = yeah I think so
K:    oh okay
D:    yeah because yeah
K:     which is [surprising ‘cos]
B:              [well maybe that] could be an extension on my study on love in Spanish [@@@]
K:                                                                  [yes yeah]
D:                                                                  [oh yeah?]
B:     I did er I did my Honours last year with K and and looked at Spanish looked at love looked at the love words amar and
      querer and and different words that Spanish has [for love]
D:                                                              [Spanish] Spanish Spain or Spanish =
B:                   = no well mine was mine was South American ‘co.. because I learnt my Spanish [in there]
D:            [okay yeah]
B:                        I did sort of base it on that and and tried to get all my [my data]
D:                                                            [ah really]
B:                                                                       from South America um so yeah that was really fun so it
      .. because Spanish has lots more probably F.. French too yeah I talked to K about French there’s more words seem to be more
      words more shades of words for love in in the Romance languages or in French and Spanish than in English
D:    mm but er we don’t make difference between like and love in French
B:    I [think you told me that]
D:      [which is not so easy]
B:    I think you told me [that] yeah
K:                      [mmm]
D:    which is not so easy for us
K:    mmm
B:    [have confusion]
D:    [so it’s always love]
all:  @@@@@@@[@@@@@]
K:                 [That’s right] they don’t bother with the like it’s straight to the love [@@@]
B:                                                                     [@@@] love everyone that’s good
K:    that’s interesting so I wonder if that’s related to the way we express or don’t express emotions
B:     mmm
K:     as much did you go over did you cover that [in your]
B                                       [yes I did] yes I did talk about emotions and emotion words in general and how we um
      English tend not to and Spanish tend tend more to um but in in in some ways it’s interesting when I talked to my um
      girlfriend from Chile she said that oh well we’ll say we she says it’s hard for me to say I love you in Spanish but it’s
      easy for me to say I love you in English (?) and that might have just been specific to her [but she said]
K:                                                                [oh okay]
D:                                                                [mmm]
B:                                                                          it’s more serious in Spanish [than]
D:                      [yeah]
B:                           in English she found but
K:     that’s funny I had a a French speaker recently say to me um it was a this couple I met here and they’ve since gone back
      to France and their first e-mail back to me had all the news and then it said at at the end um tu nous manques and then in
      brackets “I can’t say it in English because I feel like I don’t mean it” um and he said I have to tell you that in French
      and it means I miss or we miss you
B:    mm mm
K:    um but he just said I had to say that
D:    mmm
K:    in French and it’s funny when I wrote back and I said oh yeah vous me manquez which is you I miss you
B:     yeah
K:    but I’m happier saying it in French because in English it’s that’s very personal to say you I miss you
B:     mmmm
K:     and so for me it was actually easier to express it in French because maybe to me[ it didn’t feel as real]
B:                                                                     [you were feeling] [a different meaning]
K:            [but it was only way] I could do it yeah
B:    mm
K:        which is like totally the opposite to what he was saying to me [so]
B:                                                    [yeah]
K:     I said oh yeah I must go and [study that]
B/D:                              [@@@@@]
B:    put that down on my list of things to look at yeah
K:    because it being emotional is it a good thing is it a negative or positive thing do you think? If we say that if you just
      say oh yeah she gets very emotional
B:    mm [it’s]

K:           [would] that word have a negative or positive connotation or neutral?
B:    from my from what I sort of looked at if you say it in English oh she’s she’s an emotional person it’s like a it’s a more
      of a negative thing
K:        mmm
B:    um most people would take that as oh she’s a bit sort of unstable or or something like that
K:     mmm yup
B:    um rather than just she expresses emotion it’s it’s more a oh she’s a bit bit bit funny [@@]
D:                                                                     [that] sounds very English
K:    and in French would it does it have a negative connotation to say that someone is émotif?
D:    no ‘cos I think we are very Latin in the sense of we express
K/B:  mmm
D:    um perhaps not so much on the Italian people which is the other side (all @@@@) so you have to take the very true parts
      ????? just take ??? so I think we are well mainly in the south Montpellier I’m not sure.. is it a good or bad thing it’s um
      I don’t know
K:    or it just is? maybe
D:    yeah but I know it’s a question it’s important I think er I mean from my personal point of view I I’m very emotional ah I
      express myself I try to ah but people in the countryside are very hard and never show that never show their never show
      their feelings they have to be hard
B:     oh okay
D:    and I because I grew up in this kind of feelings I don’t like it so I try to go over that
K:    mmm
D:    um but if you go too far it’s not good er I it’s not good it’s not easy I find it’s not easy for me to find a well balance
      between both
K:     mmm
D:    the same in other things
K/B:   mmmm
D:     so you will say I’m unstable perhaps but um
B:    oh no no no no!!! [all @@@@)]
K:                    [those French]

      the impression that oh well they never give up on what they’re they’re talking about then they have very strong views and
      um but it’s not necessarily always bad to be opinionated you could use it when it’s not not being so negative
