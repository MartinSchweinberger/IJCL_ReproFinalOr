REDACTED who?
REDACTED
the one that owes them . the money?
what for?
services rendered
and what’s his story then about the money . was he surprised
         you were so friendly?
well I don’t know ..
cast your mind ... how much does he owe you?
twenty-five thousand
 why like what’d ya do . for him?
oh he went bust
what so you lent him 25 grand? Yeah what’d do for him then?
we had a lot of work for him and ah he never finally paid us --
so he still owes you twenty-five grand
what a nerve he’s got like what a nerve that he would ring you
         back
what’s he want now? he need more work?
he wants a loan
is he asking for a longer extension is he or what’s he asking for?
no he’s working somewhere else now .. he’s gone interstate and
         he’s not working for --
yeah he sounded like he was interstate coz he sounded like he was on
         a mobile
he’s working for a big company and ah and he wants us to look
         at some work for the big company . so that’s pretty safe
and what’s the big company
yeah you’d think he’d be a bit shy . wouldn’t you?
well he is
how long has he --
not on the phone
what can you do though . is he planning on coming back?
... have you asked him how he’s been living the last couple of
         years?
no I haven’t asked him
so it’s been a couple of years then -- -- so it’s been three or so
         years and he hasn’t paid you so yet . things aren’t  looking good
we won’t get the money back
you won’t you don’t reckon?
couldn’t possibly
yeah? Yet he still speaks to you
could you reclaim any of the stuff you sold to him?
no --
((inaudible section 7 secs))
-- --
well what’s the point of going mad? He lost more the we . he
         lost his business he lost his --
I’d go sick . I’d probably go around and ah give him the proverbial
         beating
well that’s typical of a teenager isn’t it?
no it’s not no many no . hardly any teenagers are as aggressive as me
oh well that’s all right then
... I heard that someone in your grade tried to commit suicide
         last week
. the first I’ve bloody heard of it
what an awful thing to say - -
it’s complete crap! .. Who? When? Who told you that?
a friend told me
what friend? Is she a reliable source?
hmm absolutely
who
no I’m not telling you
was it a girl who tried to commit suicide
no
what in my year?
probably been ostracised has she?
what does ostracise mean?
just you know have shit hung on her . made to feel left out
what has she how has she tried to do it?
I don’t know any details . she failed
obviously
no but she might have been ugly or something
... who was it?
I’m not saying
who was it?
you shouldn’t tell him and why’d you bring it up
yeah?
it’s not right that he should know...
but what makes . young people want to do that . what are the
         pressures of society
maybe school?
loads of pressures
you feel pressures REDACTED in Year 10?
nope
no pressures from peers?
you’ll feel pressures from my boot soon

you feel pressures from . do you feel more pressure from peers
         or parents
parents easily
really?
easily
.. in what ways . describe it
umm
his friends don’t nag him to do his homework
yeah for one . um
his friends don’t nag him to eat vegetables
they don’t get upset if I get a low mark in a test for instance and
         say you must work harder
you can’t really resist the fact that they don’t care as much
yeah obviously that’s part of that’s all part of the big step . they
         don’t care as much that’s one of the reasons why they don’t . it
         doesn’t bother me . ah they don’t they don’t bother me as much .
         because they don’t care . as much
but your family does care
a bit more youth -- girls than male
don’t know . I don’t know --
well REDACTED did a very mean thing on
         Sunday
what’s that
what did he do?
.. well we were going to the milkbar on Sunday
oh
oh here we go
and I thought how lovely it is because he wanted to walk down
         the milk bar with me
we do it every Sunday
every Sunday and I’ve always bought him some special treats .
         chocolate . this Sunday I didn’t have oh I did I gave him ninety
         cents and said what can you get for ninety cents
you can’t get shit all
stormed round the shop kicking everybody in the shop shouting
         you can’t get any jack all for ninety cents . what an awful father
         you are
all:  
and then
extreme shit
all:  
and then he won’t go with me anymore
oh REDACTED.

did you want to go for the reward
you’re a working man REDACTED

I got a shock and all this time I thought what a nice pleasant
         walking down together
oh it was mainly just ah
getting the paper and talking
oh this statement is based on ah emotion really or are you distraught
         about the chocolate bar and ah
you were led there under false pretences
 and there’s a fifty percent chance I’ll be coming down this week 
         depending on how I pull through 
not very funny REDACTED
very funny
... that was a nice tea
this was uz at tea
