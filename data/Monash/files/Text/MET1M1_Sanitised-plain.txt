         other cities
Hmm .. I s’pose it depends on what you like? … hmm .. Do you think
         Melbourne is different from other cities in Australia?
Ah .. well .. the only .. other two cities I’ve been to in Australia
         .. are .. Sydney and … no actually, I’ve been further than that …
         Well ..it’s ..it’s  more busy than Adelaide … it’s less touristy
         than ..  the Gold Coast
Yeah
It’s .. less of a smaller city than Sydney .. It’s definitely a lot
         livelier than Canberra
  Yes .. things, things tend to happen more behind closed doors in
         Canberra … All right, well thank you very much for that
