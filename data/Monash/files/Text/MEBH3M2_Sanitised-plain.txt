       all that
How long was that for?
Um, that went for four days ... from from um ... Tuesday ‘til about
       Friday
Right, and did you choose that yourself or did somebody select that
       for you?
Yeah, oh, I chose that myself, but I didn’t think it would just be
       like all gardening because I mostly just did one .. the same thing
       for like all .. for the whole four days but .. I thought it’d be just
       all different kinds of things and that
Mmm
And a bit more fun than I thought it would be
Yeah
Yeah
So, given the choice, you’d choose something else next time?
Yeah, definitely

       that’s about it; just had a few friends over once; went and saw
       movies and that

Um ... I think  saw Beavis and Butthead ... do America and that was
       was really good
Yeah
Yeah, it was really funny ... I liked that one
Yeah ... and you didn’t, you didn’t see any others?
Um ... not that I can think of, I can’t really remember
You’re not into the Star Wars trilogy at all?
Um .. I was hoping to see that once, but .. there was other movies
       that I wanted to see ‘n that .. but I was .. I didn’t really mind if
       I didn’t see it
Yeah .. yeah .. Have you ever seen .. Star Wars on the big screen?
No, no I haven’t .. well I I’ve seen ‘em all like on the TV and that
