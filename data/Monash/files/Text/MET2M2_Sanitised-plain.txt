Okay, REDACTED, what did you do during the
    summer holidays?
Um.  Let me see, I went running a lot.  Um.  I went down to Lorne and
    celebrated New Year down there.  We must of had about two weeks down
    there and I ran the Lorne mountain to surf.  That was pretty good.
So you're really into sport by the sound of it.
Just running at the moment um.
Oh right.
And I played a lot of video games too.  Um.  Shadows of the Empire.
    I'm trying to think what else I did.  I didn't really do anything
    particularly intellectual.  I painted a little bit.  Drew a little bit.
Yeap.
Um.  That probably just about concludes it.  Just relaxed, generally.
     Oh, played round on the internet for a few hours a day.
Yeap.
That would probably That would be my holiday.

    sides of the family um, mother and father.

Bit of an age difference.
Yeah, huge age difference.
Yeah.
Um.  ???  I pity her because she's got so long left at shool.  She's
    not very happy there at the moment but
Right.
It's nice to have her around, that's for sure.
Yeah.  Yeah.  Um.  Do you like the hot weather?
Um.  Oh, I'm used to it now.  I I I prefer it to the cold but then
    when it's really hot I don't know it's very tiring.  And especially it
    it makes training harder and that sort of thing.
Mmm.
And it's difficult to concentrate um.  Yeah.  I Really cold weather
    that I don't like I would like about sixteen degrees is optimum.
Right, for training you mean.
Yeap.
Yeah.  What time of day do you tend to train?
About nine or ten at night.
Oh right.  Quite late.
Yeap.  Well, it's just because I like the dark.
Yeah.
Yeap.  And
And do you do that on your own?
Yeah just on my own just
Yeah.
Go for a run, time myself and then sack (?).  Maybe during the day in
    the summer I can do some like shorter distances around the park.
Mmmhmm.
In the daytime, which is better I suppose but I like I'm sort of a
    night time creature I guess.
Mmmhmm.  And you train on your own most of the time?
Yeap.  Yeap.  Usually.
Do you feel quite safe?
Yeah, I feel quite safe, yeah.  Nothing can catch me.
