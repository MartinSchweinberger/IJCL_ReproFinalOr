Just tell me a little bit about, um, just  cos  I’m  interested,  just
      today - say - say today when we come to  school,  wha  -  what’re  you
      gonna be doing - after we’ve finished here?
I’m going to the next class
which will be
Next class will be science.
What’ve you missed this morning?
Italian.
Oh- sorry about that.
that’s fine
 - Why’s it fine?
Oh no - it’s alright cos our Italian teacher was in ‘ere  yesterday  -
      so we weren’t - I don’t think there was any work left.
So what happens when your teacher isn’t here?
Ah - another teacher.
And does that teacher know Italian?
Sometimes. It depends - sometimes the teacher might even know  nothing
      about it so it’s just ta - give out work that the teacher left.
And how good is a person - who doesn’t know Italian -  about  teaching
      Italian?
Cos - cos I’m sure  <???>  or  he  -  will  follow  the  instructions.
      Because the teacher usually gives us notes - about the  topic  -  what
      we’re doing.
So - and these teachers and the teacher that teaches you Italian  -  -
      is your Italian teacher an Italian person?
Yeah. I think she is. Not sure.
speaks Italian well?
Oh yeah. She speaks Italian.
But sometimes - when the teachers who don’t speak  Italian  well  come
      in to teach you are they like is is it good, or ...
Alright. Well, it’s - they can’t help you if you ask them a question.
Yes. Right.
We have notes about it anyway, so we have to refer to them.
OK, so after ... after - that was Italian - OK - so that’s over -  and
      the next subject - then do you have a recess at some stage or ...
Yeah. We have a recess at 10.45. Until 11.05. Then we have  our  lunch
      at 1.30 - no - uh - uh - 12.50 until 1.30.
Right. And then?
And then we have 5 and 6. Then we go home.
Right. So what subjects will you be doing in the afternoon  -  well  -
      to just go through the whole day - what’re you gonna be studying?
OK. Period 1. I have Italian. Period 2. I have science.  Then  I  have
      recess. And then a Period 3. I have religion. Period 4 - I have Sose.
Sose. Uh.
Sose, Sose - uh - Studies of  -  Social  Environment.  Something  like
      that. Oh. Social Ed.
Is that what this room is?
Yeah. I think it is. Social Ed room. Yeah.
Yeh. Yes, over there it says SOSE Learning Area. Up on that ...  book.
      Up on that top shelf there. So that’s what Sose is  -  es  oh  es  ee.
      Right. . And?
                                                         (4.3; 3.6)
And then uh the I have lunch and then Period 5 and 6 - have  a  double
      of  sport. And I’ll be doing archery.
You’re doing archery.
Yep.
Right - you won’t be shooting anybody?
A. No.
And it’ll be sport - cos we’ll be gone by then.  Ok.     I’m  a  bit
      worried about this business of the arrow  that  you  couldn’t  find  -
      that’s all.
<???> end up finding it. Cos it was an orange  one.  It  was  no  good
      anyway. They threw it out.

So how many - how many people do archery?
There’s about 15 probably <???>
All boys or ...
no there’s some girls in it
Are they good at it at all?
Um one of the girls got a bull’s eye about a week ago <???>
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh that’s pretty good.
Yeah.

Was it like um - is that because she’s very skilful or was ..  was  it
      good luck?
Oh no she really surprised me that she got it.

She couldn’t believe she got it herself.
Like aiming it somewhere else?
Yeah she was just goin’ like that and then - she was -  she  was  just
      holdin’ the bow and arrow and - <???> and went down  -  she  was  like
      screaming when she got it in, so. ...
Right. And -um, have you ever had one?
A bull’s eye.
Yeah.
No. The closest I got was - the the last section I think.
Right
The - like the arrows I got -  there’re circles and circles and  that.
      And I got the last circle.
right
One point.
OK. So it is quite hard.
Yeah. It seems easy but it’s very hard. Cos um - you can’t just -  you
      gotta really aim it - to where you’re shooting it.  And  sometimes  it
      won’t even go there.
Right. D’you know the story about the man  who  -  had  to  shoot  the
      apple off the top of his son’s head?
I think I saw that ad this morning. Yeah.
yeah it was there, oh was it there oh right. It’s an old story  from
      Switzerland apparently but ...
So - he had to pay his taxes or something
Something like that.
And you know - he -uh, and then um - if he hits -shoots the apple  off
      the head he wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it. He had to owe  money  or
      something like that I remember. And he had to shoot the arrow  on  the
      boy’s head, but he got it. He got the apple.
He got it.
Yep.
Yes. But-um would you like to have to do that?
Oh no, no.

Do you think you’d get the apple?
 No .

I’d have a better chance if I was blindfolded.
Right! OK! So I must remember never to agree to have an apple  shot
      off my head by you.
Oh not by me
 Now um ... I’d like to ask you to read for us now, read  out  loud
      the sentences on this page. Ok, just - you can leave  a  bit  of  time
      between each sentence but just - read down the page.
